Here’s a simplified and corrected version of the content for a layman reader:

### **Project Overview**  
The goal is to enhance the existing system (shown in green boxes) by adding new functionality (white boxes) as part of development task **Epic-6FITFUN-4431**.  

### **What Needs to Be Done?**  
1. **Create an EOD Container**:  
   - This container will handle CFO risk for non-USD accrual products.  
   - It will populate "Publishable Units (PU)" and related tables.  

2. **Build Calculators for Risk**:  
   - Develop calculators to measure **Interest Rate (IR)** and **Foreign Exchange (FX)** risks for these products:  
     - ICL, MW, FX Capital, Cash, and Economic Debt.  
   - The calculators must:  
     - Include all accrual products from the Central Data Model (CDM).  
     - Run only after all data is loaded.  
     - Publish IR & FX risk data to "Zinc Official" under a snapshot.  

3. **Coordination**:  
   - Work with the Zinc team to ensure the snapshot system works correctly and PUs are loaded as expected.  

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- The system must meet the End-of-Day (EOD) deadline (SLA).  
- Existing functionality should not be disrupted.  
- Documentation must be updated.  

### **Testing Steps**  
1. Verify that the updated EOD stack includes new jobs.  
2. Check that data flows from CDM to the sandra database at:  
   `/Applications/CFORisk/frtb/` (with separate folders for each product).  
3. Confirm that IR & FX risk values match the data in CDM.  
4. Ensure the EOD containers for "Deal & Finance PU" are populated.  
5. Validate that tables and data are stored here:  
   `/Closes/CFO.CFORISK.FATB.AMBS/(patchDate)/EOO/PublishableUnits/`.  
6. Test with Zinc to confirm snapshots work and data appears in Zinc Official.  

### **Assumptions**  
- All required data is already available in CDM.  
- Currently, risk data for the 5 products (ICL, MW, FX Capital, Cash, Econ Debt) is sent to **Zinc FATB** but not to **Zinc Official**.  
- Only MRS can read from Zinc Official, which sends data to **Zinc DO Hub** (for daily quality checks).  

### **Summary of Changes**  
- No new system is needed—just add new jobs to the existing **EOD stack** (`eod_cfrosik_frtb_amrs`).  
- Fetch trade data from CDM for the 5 products and store it in the "corp_zf" ring of the sandra database.  
- Build IR & FX calculators and send feeds to Zinc Official.  
- Collaborate with Zinc to set up registry-based snapshots.  

### **Technical Impact**  
- **No architecture changes**—only additional jobs in the existing EOD stack.  
- **No UI changes**—data is pulled from CDM and stored in sandra DB for risk calculations.
