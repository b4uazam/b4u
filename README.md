Here’s a structured **description** for your EPIC, covering **Summary of Change**, **Implementation**, and **Application Details**:

### **1. Summary of Change**  
**Objective:**  
Optimize the ICL booking flow performance by refactoring inefficient **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) calls** that introduce latency, improving user experience and reducing business losses.  

**Scope:**  
- Target: Booking flow modules with slow DAG evaluations.  
- Outcome: Faster load times, higher booking completion rates.  

**Key Metrics:**  
- Reduce DAG call execution time by **≥50%** (e.g., from 2000ms to 1000ms).  
- Improve booking flow completion rate by **X%**.

### **2. How Was the Change Implemented?**  
**Implementation Steps:**  
1. **Analysis & Benchmarking:**  
   - Profiled slow DAG calls using [tools: APM, logs].  
   - Identified bottlenecks (e.g., sequential dependencies, redundant queries).  

2. **Refactoring Strategies:**  
   - **Replaced DAG calls** with optimized in-memory logic for static rules.  
   - **Introduced caching** (e.g., Redis) for repeatable evaluations.  
   - **Parallelized** independent DAG nodes where possible.  

3. **Testing & Validation:**  
   - A/B tested refactored flows against legacy DAG calls.  
   - Validated performance gains using synthetic/user traffic.  

**Tools & Tech:**  
- Profiling: New Relic/Datadog.  
- Caching: Redis/Memcached.  
- Code: [Languages/frameworks used, e.g., Python, Airflow].

### **3. Application Detail Changes**  
**Before Refactoring:**  
- DAG calls evaluated in real-time, causing delays.  
- Booking flow latency: **2000ms avg**.  

**After Refactoring:**  
- **Logic Changes:**  
  - Static rules moved to application memory.  
  - Dynamic rules cached with **TTL: 5min**.  
- **Architecture Changes:**  
  - Decoupled DAG dependencies via async processing.  
- **Results:**  
  - Booking flow latency: **1000ms avg** (50% reduction).  
  - CPU/memory usage improved by **30%**.  

**Impacted Modules:**  
- Booking eligibility checker.  
- Pricing engine.  
- Inventory resolver.  

**Dependencies/Risks:**  
- Requires monitoring cache invalidation logic.  
- Legacy systems may still call DAGs (fallback needed).

### **Why This Structure?**  
- **Summary:** Sets context/goals for stakeholders.  
- **Implementation:** Replicable steps for engineers.  
- **Details:** Helps QA/ops teams validate changes.
