The error you're encountering is a `JsonParseException` thrown by the Jackson library, which is used by Spring Boot for JSON parsing. The error message indicates that Jackson encountered an unexpected token (`'Invalid'`) when it was expecting a valid JSON structure (like a string, number, array, object, `null`, `true`, or `false`).

Here’s a breakdown of the issue and steps to resolve it:

---

### **Root Cause**
- The error occurs because the application is receiving an invalid JSON payload in the request to the `/hedgerelations/initiate` endpoint.
- The payload being sent to the server is not properly formatted JSON. Instead of valid JSON, it contains the string `'Invalid'`, which Jackson cannot parse.

---

### **Steps to Resolve**

#### 1. **Check the Request Payload**
   - Identify the client or service making the request to `/hedgerelations/initiate`.
   - Verify that the request payload is properly formatted JSON.
   - Example of valid JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "key": "value"
     }
     ```
   - If the payload is `'Invalid'`, it is not valid JSON and needs to be corrected.

#### 2. **Log the Request Payload**
   - Add logging to capture the incoming request payload in your Spring Boot application. This will help you identify what is being sent to the server.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @PostMapping("/hedgerelations/initiate")
     public ResponseEntity<?> initiateHedgeRelation(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
         log.info("Received request payload: {}", requestBody);
         // Process the request
     }
     ```

#### 3. **Validate JSON Before Processing**
   - Add validation to ensure the incoming payload is valid JSON before attempting to parse it.
   - You can use a library like `org.json` or `Jackson` to validate the JSON structure.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

     public boolean isValidJson(String json) {
         try {
             ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
             mapper.readTree(json);
             return true;
         } catch (Exception e) {
             return false;
         }
     }
     ```

#### 4. **Handle Invalid JSON Gracefully**
   - If the JSON is invalid, return a meaningful error response to the client instead of allowing the application to throw an exception.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @PostMapping("/hedgerelations/initiate")
     public ResponseEntity<?> initiateHedgeRelation(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
         if (!isValidJson(requestBody)) {
             return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Invalid JSON payload");
         }
         // Process the request
     }
     ```

#### 5. **Check Client-Side Code**
   - If you control the client making the request, ensure that it is sending properly formatted JSON.
   - Example of a correct HTTP request with JSON payload:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST https://your-server/hedgerelations/initiate \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"key": "value"}'
     ```

#### 6. **Review API Documentation**
   - If the client is a third-party service, ensure that they are following the API contract and sending valid JSON.
   - Provide clear documentation for your API to avoid misunderstandings.

#### 7. **Enable Detailed Error Logging**
   - Enable detailed error logging in Spring Boot to capture more context about the issue.
   - Add the following to your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:
     ```properties
     logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
     logging.level.com.fasterxml.jackson=DEBUG
     ```

#### 8. **Test with a Valid Payload**
   - Use a tool like Postman or cURL to manually test the `/hedgerelations/initiate` endpoint with a valid JSON payload to ensure the endpoint works as expected.

### **Example Fix**
Here’s an example of how you might modify your controller to handle invalid JSON gracefully:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
public class HedgeRelationController {

    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @PostMapping("/hedgerelations/initiate")
    public ResponseEntity<?> initiateHedgeRelation(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
        try {
            // Validate JSON
            objectMapper.readTree(requestBody);
            // Process the request
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Request processed successfully");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Invalid JSON payload: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary**
The error is caused by an invalid JSON payload being sent to your Spring Boot application. To resolve it:
1. Verify the request payload is valid JSON.
2. Add logging to capture the incoming payload.
3. Validate JSON before processing.
4. Handle invalid JSON gracefully.
5. Ensure the client is sending properly formatted JSON.
