Here‚Äôs your EPIC problem statement reframed in the clear **"What? Why? How?"** format:  

---

### **What?**  
**Problem:** The ICL booking flow is slow due to inefficient **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) calls**, causing user frustration and business losses.  

### **Why?**  
**Impact:**  
- **Users:** Delays lead to abandoned bookings and poor experience.  
- **Business:** Revenue loss from drop-offs; reputational damage.  
- **Root Cause:** DAG calls are time-consuming (e.g., sequential, unoptimized, or over-fetching data).  

### **How?**  
**Solution:** Refactor DAG calls by:  
1. Replacing them with optimized logic (e.g., in-memory processing).  
2. Implementing caching for repeatable evaluations.  
3. Parallelizing or simplifying dependencies.  

**Success Metrics:**  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Latency:** Reduce booking flow time by **X%** (e.g., 50%).  
- üìä **Throughput:** Increase successful bookings by **Y%**.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Technical:** Cut DAG call execution time from **[Current]ms** to **[Target]ms**.

### **Agile Advantage:**  
- **Clarity:** Aligns teams on the **problem** (what), **urgency** (why), and **action** (how).  
- **Measurability:** Metrics keep progress tangible.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Break into user stories (e.g., _"Cache DAG evaluation results for booking step 1"_).  
- Add a **spike** to audit DAG dependencies if needed.
